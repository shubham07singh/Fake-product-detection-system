## 🧾 Abstract

This project uses **Decentralized Blockchain Technology** to help users identify genuine products. By leveraging blockchain’s tamper-proof and transparent nature, brands can record product details securely. It helps manufacturers avoid the high cost of running direct-operated stores by ensuring trust directly through the tech.

---

## 💡 Motivation

The rise of **counterfeit goods** globally has had a devastating effect on brand trust, revenue, and consumer safety. By building a **fully functional blockchain-based system**, this project helps even **small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)** protect their products and consumers without relying on third parties.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

- Increasing circulation of **fake products** like medicines, toys, etc.
- Fake goods damage company reputation and pose safety risks.
- Detecting fakes is hard with current systems.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

- A **blockchain-based system** records ownership of each product.
- **QR codes** generated from blockchain data to verify authenticity.
- Blocks are secure, transparent, and immutable — preventing tampering.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an **anti-counterfeit system** using blockchain.
- Secure product info via **QR codes**.
- Provide **transparency** and data access to end users.
- Enable users to **verify product authenticity** independently.
